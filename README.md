# Complet-Register-Login-System

This registration system request email confirmation.<br>
In this project I worked with PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS.<br>
In the back end part I used PHP to communicate with database, I used functions and algorithms to protect MySQL injection.<br>
Exemplex:<br>
-mysqli_real_escape_string: escapes special characters in a string for use in an SQL statement (\n, \r, \, ', ",)<br>
-md5: hash string<br>
-uniqid: generate unique identifier based on the current time in microseconds<br>
-mt_rand: generate a random value<br>
-strlen: get string length<br>
-etc<br>
I used these functions to create unique id activating user accounts, to ensure that the user enters the correct data in the registration/login fields, to save the password in the database in a secure way, etc...<br>
I used CRUD type operations in MySQL.<br>
For the design part I used CSS.
